### Redo the PCB. - August 30, 2025 <a id="redo-the-pcb.-2025-08-30"></a>

**Time Spent:** 2h 0m  

#### What I Did

Redo the PCB routing with smaller tactile switches.

#### Issues Faced

I randomly added a switch from lcsc, after I exported the step and opened in Fusion, I found that the buttons were too big, specially for making a gamepad, so I replaced them with smaller ones and did the PCB again.

#### Next Steps

Make the Case, most probably

**Time Spent:** 2h 0m  

#### What I Did

Completed the top and bottom part of the case.

#### Issues Faced

Mainly components required different type of space, so had to redo PCB a couple of times to actually make it work.

#### Next Steps

Make the caps for the switches.

### Completed the case with buttons. - September 03, 2025 <a id="completed-the-case-with-buttons-2025-09-03"></a>

**Time Spent:** 3h 0m  

#### What I Did

1. Modified the positions of Joysticks, D-pad and Face buttons on the PCB, as they all appeared to be congested in a small space.  
2. Adjusted the case accordingly.  
3. Replaced the L and R buttons positions, completed and polished the case.  

#### Issues Faced

None.  

#### Next Steps

Polish the case further, add screw holes.
